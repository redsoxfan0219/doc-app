"""The |Glossary| object"""

class Glossary:
    # def __init__(self, )
    # Unsure what would need to go here for the time being



# todo 
# METHOD: FETCH AND PRINT MENU
# Fetch and print the current 'home menu'--explaining how
# to use the glossary, explaining what types of information
# can be pulled from here, etc. Based on user input, 
# fetch and print again for whatever option is chosen--e.g.
# Option 'Methodology' --> Prints out list of the
# methodologies currently included in the glossary


# todo
# METHOD: INJECT RELEVANT MATERIAL INTO DOCUMENT
# If someone needs to use the glossary to figure out 
# what kinds of information they should document for a 
# given methodology, it would be nice to give them
# template components that could be injected into their
# document. Could have some kind of option like: Which
# section would you like to insert this empty table of 
# standard XGBoost hyperparameters, definitions, value
# range, rationale for tuning this parameter, etc


# Could be a chance to use model-view-controller pattern.
# Example: Print out current list of entries. Select an entry.
# For the selected entry, choose from: (1) Definition, (2) Templates,
# (3) Resources.

# For (2) Templates, choose: 
#   (1) download an informational pdf containing info
#   about templating options for the given methodology, sample templates, help text, etc
# 
#   OR
#
#   (2) Import a template component into an existing document
